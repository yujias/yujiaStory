One day, Tom is hanging around the street. Suddenly, he just find jerry is playing badminton in front of a wall. And he went to Jerry and asked, "Why you just play badminton alone, it's quite boring.". "Since I don't have any friends, this wall is all I got."

Anyways they ended up playing Badminton together when a giant bang was heard off in the distance.   The two of them looked up and suddenly saw an asteroid hurtling torwards the badmiton court.   They were mystified on what to do.   Tom said, should we call the police.   Jerry said, "Run!"   So with that being said they both ran out of the area and watched as the asteroid impacted the badmiton court.

They went home together. And Tom found his master had a new cat at home. The new cat was handsome. And his master said that if Tom could not catch the mouses, he would not get fish to eat.

So suddenly, Jerry feels a force upon his waist. Tom had grabbed Jerry. Not knowing what to do, Jerry tried to force Tom's hand open but could not. Before Tom could hand Jerry over to his master. Jerry was already dead. All the air had already been pushed out of him. He had died of suffocation. Then all the moments of them playing badminton together flashes before Tom's eyes. He said no to his master and took Jerry's corpse and burried it, while balling his eyes out. Never has Tom felt so much regret.
